In-order steps of initialization


Initial check for tty or not.

Find core OS name from kernel with "uname".

Different OSes need different uname breakdowns to find out stats.

determine what system fix-ups are needed for common commands.

 -- build a later version of shell?


Load basic environment configuration variables (login or not)

decide if login or batch-session.


For batch: Load batch-specific settings.



Otherwise:
Switch to TCSH loading.

Load login for first login bits.
Load tcshrc for first login bits.

 -- First launch tcshrc

 -- These are sourced from tcshrc.system
Load arch specific tcshrc bits
Load OS specific tcshrc bits
Load machine speciifc tchsrc bits
Load organization/network specific tcshrc bits
Load user specific tcshrc bits


-- These get launched by tcshrc.alias
Load arch specific alias bits
Load OS specific alias bits
Load machine speciifc tchsrc bits
Load organization/network specific alias bits
Load user specific alias bits

Load arch specific completion bits
Load OS specific completion bits
Load machine speciifc tchsrc bits
Load organization/network specific completion bits
Load user specific completion bits

Load arch specific bindkey bits
Load OS specific bindkey bits
Load machine speciifc tchsrc bits
Load organization/network specific bindkey bits
Load user specific bindkey bits

 -- Do prompt last, since it is not that useful beforehand.
Load tcshrc prompt

----------------------------------------------


Start by acknowledging that both login and tcshrc are sourced.
